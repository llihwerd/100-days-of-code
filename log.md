# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 24, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Updated CSS in deck wizard app & did troubleshooting for form submission error on new deck form.

**Thoughts:** The CSS was acting weird at first, but I discovered we need to change the decklist CSS to module instead of having it as global. That should fix the couple issues.
